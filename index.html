        <h2>Why I joined Code Nation</h2>
        <p> I joined code nation with a goal in mimnd, that goal was to get as much information, knowledge and experince
            in cyber security and computer coding/language, web development. I had been to several open evenings in
            relation to the subjects but code nation just felt right so I pursued my interest to going on the course.
            Two of the code nation team memebers was very helpful and assisted me all the way to getting on the course,
            and thats where my journey with code nation started.</p>

        <h2>My interest in technology and coding</h2>
        <p> My interest in computer sciences dates back to when I was age 16 years old whilst attending school & college. On completing school I started my career in learning about computers with a company called YMCA, where they were offering students like me the opportunity to begin a course in computing. during the course in studied basic computer studies but this was where I found my passion for it and wanted to take it further and since then i have had a fascination with technology and computer science.
            My enthusiasm to the uses of technology and computers and how it can be applied in the modern world really does excite me. A long standard interest in computers has given me a basic understanding of the different programming languages has give me a huge value of data base, multimedia facilities and web technology. My perspective computers make tasks much easier and quicker that was once a little more difficult. With technology moving so fast no one really knows or can predict where we are going to be or what the next bit of best technology is going to be and that really intrigues and excites me more.Learning computer languages and being able to write my own particular codes which transfer to websites is such a psychological pleasure that you only get to experience once you have achieved it, and my love and skills for problem solving backs up why i enjoy computer science.</p>

        <h2>The purpose of IT in modern businesses</h2>
        <p> IT has many key purposes in modern business and is a key function when creating a successful business. IT
            can allow a company to maximise on its profits whilst reducing its manpower as it can promote its products &
            services to a mass market. IT can be used to protect a companies internal functions & to ensure they have an
            advantage on their competitors. Technology is very important in captuing and keeping safe financial data and
            personal data of their employers. IT allows a business to develop their services and allow continuous
            improvement to keep up to date with their consumers. IT allows businesses to communicate in a fast manner
            and efficiently with the consumer which is key in a modern day business.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>The risks that might impact digital projects</h2>
        <p> As mentioned IT is a key factor in modern day business but this means there are also many risks which must be
            considered before carrying out a digital project. You may start a digital project and half way through Apple
            could introduce a new IOS which would then not be compatible with your current design. We must stay up to
            date with changes but also ensure we consider these risks before starting a project. As digital projects
            usually take time this also means a businesses competitors could develop a feature before your design is
            finished which would then mean losing potential customers. As digital projects are usually costly we must
            consider budgets & timescales as if they are not met this could be a huge risk for a modern day business.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully</h2>
        <p> To complete a digital project successfully there are many methods, skills and resources we must have in order
            to achieve our goals.
            A key factor is planning the method we will carry out to complete the project. We can liaise with
            stakeholders, the client, the IT team to discuss the scope of the project and how we are going to deliver it
            on time. We must consider risk factors, what could go wrong and what must we consider? we must consider
            timescales and costing whilst being flexible as we know things can change along the project. A key resource
            is building a team with different skill sets who can bring different ideas and methods to the project.
            We must produce clear design schedules to follow and are implemented in the correct manner. We must then
            ensure the project is developed correctly, front end and back end so they can then be tested correctly and
            tweaked if needed before going live.
            Once the project is tested and ready for deployment, it must then have continuous maintenance and changes
            are kept up to date. </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>how would you go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h2>
        <p> When selecting an IT System and software we must consider many factors and understand specific uses for the
            business. If a company is within the retail sector then using a single system would not be productive as
            modern day companies need to access data and business information in real time so they can make changes if
            needed. A retail business would therefore benefit from using a cloud solution system which integrated
            various business elements including inventory, sales, stock, ecommerce, CRM etc.
            Modern day businesses must work with systems that allow continous improvement and evolves with future
            growth. Choosing a wrong system would mean that if a company needed to change due to future growth it would
            end up being costly and time consuming in getting a whole new system which then allows this.
            Carry out market research, taking into consideration the industry which the company falls into, investigate
            new technology, analyse competitors.
            Cloud based solutions allow for tailored made systems which are key when wanting a system which allows for
            growth & continous improvement.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects</h2>
        <p> There are many legal guidelines which we must follow when starting a digital project.
            Copywriting
            GDPR - email & sms marketing - opt out procedures
            Website designs must carry your companies registered address & company number
            Using Cookies - as cookies capture data & information which is then sent back to the business, the business
            must therefore infom the consumer that cookies are being used.
            Information on public cloud systems- data protection act
            Computer Fraud & Abuse act
            Children's online privacy act</p>

        <p> Within GDPR there are other laws or rules that must we must adhere to including the following:</p>
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>The right to be informed is about the obligations and transparency of data being used and held to be
                notified and the ability to access it at a given request.</li>
            <li>The right of access tells the consumer whether any data is being used with a company or any other</li>
            <li>The right to rectification gives any individual the right to have any inaccurate information or data
                rectified.</li>
            <li>The right to erasure gives individuals the right to be forgotten or for their information/data to be
                erased. although this right is a good thing it is not absolute and depends on the circumstances.</li>
            <li>The right to restrict processing gives an individual the right to have their information/data by
                organisations restricted, and is an alternative to rights to erasure.</li>
            <li>The right to data portability allows the data subject to request copies of all personal data which the
                dat subject has to provide. The right to data portability allows citizens to be able to move between
                various service providers without any loss of data, ie not having to put in their information again.
            </li>
            <li>The right to object gives the individuals the right to object that their personal data not be processed
                and have the total rights for their data not to be used in direct marketing.</li>
            <li>Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling gives you the option to not be
                automatically selected for other websites, giving you the opportunity to select the ones that you do
                want your data shared with.</li>
        </ul>

        <p> In modern day businesses GDPR is a key factor which must be considered especially when a business model
            relies on personal data being collected. As consumers have the right to take all their original data, this
            means they can have an easy transition and switch over to a competitor which is and can be a potential.</p>

        <h2>Analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes</h2>

        <p> Using trello to help me keep to my step by step processes was very useful, trello allowed me to put my work
            in 3 catergories. To Do, Going and Done this was very useful as it allowed me to put things in the
            catergories if I wanted to switch between objectives or tasks. leaving some tasks in To Do and doing meant
            that I knew what to go back to if I had'nt finished it. Trello also helped me to put tasks into order of
            importance. Another great tool I used was Github, this allowed me to store code onto Github, save it and add
            any more code I wanted to it which I found very helpful.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Describing the content and layout for each page</h2>

        <p> On my web page i have decided to stick to the one page, my reason . was just to keep things simple and easy
            to navigate. My web page had different font sizes using between h1-h6, also with content i added a image
            from free source google pic and also left the style of text to what it was set at. when having a website a
            home, content, about us, contact us, services offered and a portfolio page is very useful.</p>

    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Describing copyright and other constraints</h2>

        <p> When creating a website it is better to assume they are protected with by copyright, trademarks or other
            constraints.
            Most websites that are online and for the public domain are protected by various laws.
            When using data, pictures or information we must read the terms of conditions even if it states that they
            are free to use.
            If we have a website and someone complains about the information on it or pictures used we must remove
            immediately. This does not mean what we have posted should not of been used but we should clearly
            investigate it before re using the picture, information or link.
            If something is used without unauthorisation then we should also investigate this immediately.
            The best way to prevent all of this is by simply seeking permission to use the information in the first
            place.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may
            face when using webpages and how we can overcome them</h2>

        <p> When using webpages we may come across many access issues that need taking into consideration. We must
            consider day to day users and also within this people with disabilities.
            When using webpages we must ensure there are no visual, audio or motor problems for people with
            disabilities.
            There are many common access issues including:
            Colour content and visability, light coloured text which may be difficult to see.
            This could affect people with visual impairments, colour blindness, blindness or users with good vision as
            the contrast of colours is not clear.
            Keyboard accessibility: we must ensure that everything we can do with a keyboard on our webpage must be able
            to be used mouse-less too.
            You could also introduce with webpages that include audio assistance or brail keyboards.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Describe which are the appropriate file types</h2>

        <p> CSS - used to plain web content
            JPEG - used worldwide and this format is typically used to post on social media, share on email, publish on
            websites
            GIF - You can use GIF to create animations on your webpage
            PNG - Great when you use small logos
            PDF - save documents which can then be imported and used on your website
            INDD - used to create a professional page layout, great for creatin flyers, brochures, magazines, books.
            Html - Is used to create webstites and web applications</p>

        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used?</h2>

            <p>On reviewing my website and the ongoing use of IT tools I was very happy with the productivity of them. Each had their specific purpose and worked well with one another, making the project run a lot smoother and also made the visual effects look more effective. the use of css on html pair great together and being able to use my website to Github repository was effective to. Trello was helpful to update and use as a indicator for unfinished tasks. All in all a great experience using the IT tools.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello</h2>

            <p>I found the IT tools very appropriate for the project I was doing, on more complexed projects then i could have tested them more. However VS Code was efficient and so was Trello as i was able to put all my work on Trello then copy and paste it onto my html website with no real issues. I never really used code pen, i have read up on it and this would have also been a useful tool to put code on to.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h2>

            <p> Overall I am happy with my website due to the fact this is my first website design. I stuck to a very basic layout and ensured the information was clear and precise. In the future with more practice and a better understanding of the different languages I would definitely introduce a more complex design.
                I would include more technical features such as, interactive buttons, pop ups, slide shows, images which are placed behind writing and sound. 
                I like how i have introduced a navigation bar and a colour scheme which i believe to be attractive to most people. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h2>

            <p>If I were to add any further improvements to my website It would have been the layout, making the content have some more visuals, possibly put pictures which fade in the background or come across the writing, also different fonts and styles to make it look a little bit more quirky, and also different columns with speech bubbles, style and font, added some sound to the website so not only is it visual but audio which would make it a lot more user friendly for people with disabilities and also add some interactive pop ups.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h2>
        
            <p> After reviewing the outcomes and following examples given I would possibly change a few things, however I have featured everything mentioned on my blog and created a basic website with some interesting information. Although it is a basic website I found that all my objectives were met, understanding and implemnting different aspects to it.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h2>

            <p> Trello has been great for efficiency and for helping me to organise my work load and creating to do lists. I have found it particularly useful in organising my layout and ensuring all bases are covered.
                VS Code - has been a great tool to use when creating my first website, the coding is very clear and once I understood the basics I found it very easy to apply to my website.
                I now can write code successfully, create different colour schemes, include text borders, introduce navigation boards and different fonts. I love that once the code is written my website changes instantly so I can decide if it looks correct or if I would like to change any of the features. Personally I dont think any of the tools have had any drawbacks as I have been able to develop a basic & clear website design.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h2>

            <p> I think I could save a library of already written code snippets so that I can simply copy & paste when needed. This would be less time consuming that writing code from scratch.
                I could save images and information for future use which I could use so I can simply slot them into the code
                Read up and do more independant learning to work on more complex designs
                Take breaks and stay refreshed to allow productivity and efficiency to be at its highest.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
            <h2>Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h2>

            <p> Things I would consider doing to improve productivity would be to create code in a library to use when needed.
                work in teams or ask other individuals how thy have created more complex designs.
                Research colour schemes which are proven to work well on website designs
                save colours number codes.
                Research and read up on website designs to produce a more creative project.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h2>

            <p> The main aim of the testing would be to check how functional my website is for the end user.
                We need to check the following to ensure the information included is what the user wants, they are able to navigate around the website easily, the speed of the website is fast when clicking on different pages, visually looks pleasing & welcoming. We want to check social media interaction and accessibility. we must ensure data is protected and we have the right security in place. We must ensure it is compliant with website laws & regulations.
                web testing, mobile testing, app testing
                Test network virtualization
                Validate website content
                monitor social media interaction
                privacy, security & compliance testing
                Testing speed and interaction
                check usability</p>
